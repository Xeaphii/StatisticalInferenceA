StatisticalInferenceA
=====================

Statistical Inference assignment 2
This is the project for the statistical inference class. In it, you will use simulation to explore inference and
do some simple inferential data analysis. The project consists of two parts:
1. Simulation exercises.
2. Basic inferential data analysis.
You will create a report to answer the questions. Please use knitr to create the reports and convert to a
pdf. (I will post a very simple introduction to knitr). Each pdf report should be no more than 2 pages
with 3 pages of supporting appendix material if needed (code, figures, etcetera)
